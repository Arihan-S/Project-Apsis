# Project-Apsis

## Purpose 
  The purpose of this repository is to document the tools and data used in my AP Research 2021 final academic paper. 

### Project Overview

    My research project, titled Project Apsis (Apsis meaning the furthest or nearest point in the orbit of a planetary body about its primary body) focuses on space debris in Medium Earth Orbit, and evaluating the past, present, and future environment as a result of this debris. To accomplish this goal I utilized the European Space Agency's Space Debris User Portal (located here: https://sdup.esoc.esa.int) and the MASTER (Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference) analysis toolsuite as well as user-scripts I created to automate the data collection and handaling process. The in-depth explanation of my research process and results is detailed in my final research paper, included in this repository. 
    
    Included in this repository are the input and data automation shell scripts, located in the input-automation and data-automation directories respectively, as well as the input and output files used with the MASTER tool suite for each analysis period conducted. The boilerplate input files are located in the input-files directory and the input and output files used for each analysis period session are located in the output-files directory in the appropriate time period directory. 
    
    The data in this repository as well as the included user-scripts require a working installation of the MASTER tool suite in a Linux environment (Note: this project has only been tested on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed). The application is not included in this repository but can be acquired from the ESA Space Debris User Portal mentioned above.
